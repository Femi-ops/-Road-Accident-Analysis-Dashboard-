# 🚧 Road Accident Analysis Dashboard 📊

![Dashboard Preview](./bi_road%20accident.png)

## 🚀 Overview

This project presents a **dynamic, data-driven dashboard** analyzing road accidents across the United Kingdom. Leveraging interactive visualizations, this BI tool aims to offer **deep insights into accident patterns** by vehicle type, road types, urban vs rural settings, lighting conditions, and monthly trends. The goal is to empower policymakers, traffic departments, urban planners, and data scientists with actionable intelligence to **reduce casualties and enhance road safety**.

## 📌 Key Insights

### 📉 Accident & Casualty Trends

- **Total CY Casualties:** 195.7K, reflecting an **11.9% decline** from the previous year.
- **Fatal Casualties:** 2.9K, showcasing a significant **33.3% drop**—a positive safety indicator.
- **Serious Casualties:** 27.0K (↓16.2%)
- **Slight Casualties:** 165.8K (↓10.6%)
- **Total Accidents:** 144.4K, down by **11.7%** year-over-year.

This trend suggests a systemic improvement in **road safety measures**, possibly due to better traffic regulations, vehicle safety features, or public awareness.

## 🚗 Casualty Breakdown by Vehicle Type

| Vehicle Type   | Casualties |
|----------------|------------|
| 🚜 Agricultural | 399        |
| 🛵 Bike         | 15,610     |
| 🚌 Bus          | 6,573      |
| 🚗 Car          | 155,804    |
| 📦 Van          | 15,905     |
| 🚫 Other        | 1,446      |

> **Cars** remain the highest contributor to road casualties, followed by vans and bikes, indicating where safety measures should be concentrated.

---

## 📆 Casualties Over Time

A month-by-month comparison between **current year (CY)** and **previous year (PY)** reveals fluctuating trends, with notable spikes during **summer months (May–September)** and a consistent **drop in December**, potentially due to weather conditions or seasonal travel behavior.

---

## 🌍 Urban vs. Rural Impact

- **Urban Areas:** 61.95%
- **Rural Areas:** 38.05%

Urban regions contribute to a majority of casualties, aligning with **higher traffic density**, intersections, and pedestrian presence.

## 🛣️ Road Type Analysis

| Road Type        | Casualties |
|------------------|------------|
| Single Carriageway | 145K     |
| Dual Carriageway   | 32K      |
| Roundabout         | 13K      |
| One-way Street     | 3K       |
| Slip Road          | 3K       |

> **Single carriageways** dominate accident scenes. This underlines the importance of strategic road design and potential re-engineering.

---

## 🌞 Light Condition Analysis

- **Daytime Accidents:** 73.84%
- **Nighttime (Dark):** 26.16%

Despite the intuition that nights are riskier, most accidents occur **during the day**—likely due to higher road usage volume.

---

## 🗺️ Spatial Distribution of Accidents

A geographical heat map (powered by **Microsoft Bing Maps**) shows a **dense cluster of incidents across major UK cities** including London, Birmingham, and Manchester. This supports targeting **urban hotspots** for infrastructure upgrades and law enforcement.

---

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

- **Power BI / Tableau** for data visualization  
- **CSV/Excel** data source  
- **Microsoft Bing Maps API** for location plotting  
- **Python (Pandas, NumPy)** – if integrated in preprocessing

---

## 📈 Potential Extensions

- 🔄 Integration with **real-time traffic data** using public APIs  
- 🧠 Implement **predictive models** (e.g., accident risk prediction)  
- 📍 Add **filtering by weather, speed limit zones, and driver behavior**  
- 📱 Embed the dashboard into a **mobile-friendly web interface**
